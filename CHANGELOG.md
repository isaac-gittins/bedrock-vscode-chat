## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Multi-turn Conversation Tool Result Preservation**: Fixed critical bug causing "Expected toolResult blocks" validation errors after ~10-43 conversation turns with tool use
  - Added `hasToolHistory()` function to detect tool blocks in message history
  - Modified tool preservation logic to check both current request AND message history
  - Tool result blocks are now preserved regardless of whether current request includes tools
  - Prevents orphaned tool call blocks that caused Bedrock API validation failures
  - Added debug logging for tool preservation decisions
  - Enhanced `validateRequest()` with better error tracking

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Native Bedrock Tool Calling**: Fixed validation to prevent incorrectly caching "tool unsupported" when request is missing tool results
  - Added pre-flight validation for native Bedrock requests to ensure tool calls have corresponding results
  - Distinguish between tool-config-not-supported errors vs missing-tool-result errors
  - Models no longer incorrectly marked as "no tools" when tool results are missing from context

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Comprehensive Makefile with development, build, and publishing targets
  - Development targets: `install`, `compile`, `watch`, `lint`, `dev`
  - Build targets: `package`, `publish`, `check`
  - Cleanup targets: `clean`, `clean-all`
  - Version management: `version-patch`, `version-minor`, `version-major`
- ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`) for TypeScript linting support

### Changed
- Reorganized build artifacts into `dist/` directory (cleaner root)
- Updated `.gitignore` to ignore `dist/` folder instead of individual `*.vsix` files
- Improved publish workflow with built-in compilation and linting verification

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **AWS Credentials Support for Mantle**: Mantle models now support both API key and AWS credential authentication
  - New authentication method selector in management UI
  - AWS SigV4 signing for Mantle requests when using credentials
  - Separate profile configuration for Mantle (`mantleAwsProfile`) and Native Bedrock (`awsProfile`)
  - Configuration option: `aws-bedrock.mantleAuthMethod` (apiKey | awsCredentials)
  - Configuration option: `aws-bedrock.mantleAwsProfile`

### Changed
- Enhanced "Manage AWS Bedrock" menu with authentication method selection
- Improved authentication flow to support both methods seamlessly
- Better error messages that specify which authentication method failed

### Dependencies
- Added `@aws-sdk/signature-v4` for AWS request signing
- Added `@aws-crypto/sha256-js` for signature hashing

## [0.2.4] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed
- **Output Channel Logging**: Replaced console.log with Output Channel logging for visibility in installed extension
  - Extension now creates "AWS Bedrock" output channel
  - All debug and error messages visible via View → Output → AWS Bedrock
  - Console output only appeared in Extension Development Host, not in installed extension

### Changed
- **Dependency Packaging**: Fixed .vscodeignore to include node_modules in VSIX
  - AWS SDK dependencies now bundled with extension
  - Resolves "Cannot find module '@aws-sdk/client-bedrock'" error
  - Extension size increased from 50KB to ~3MB but now works when installed

### Added
- Improved icon with sunburst gradient and horizon glow effect
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces
- Better activation error handling

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- Documented critical learnings about:
  - Publisher name (must be lowercase: easytocloud)
  - Testing environments (F5 vs installed extension)
  - Logging best practices
  - Icon conversion workflow (rsvg-convert)
  - Dependency packaging requirements
