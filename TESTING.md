## Local Testing Guide: Tool Result Block Fix

### Quick Test Results ✅

All verification tests have passed:
- ✅ Source code structure verified
- ✅ Compiled output verified  
- ✅ Integration test (multi-turn conversation simulation) passed
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeded
- ✅ ESLint checks passed

### Testing with the VS Code Extension

#### Prerequisites
1. AWS Bedrock API credentials configured
2. VS Code installed
3. This repository cloned locally

#### Step 1: Start the Extension in Debug Mode

```bash
# From the repository root
npm run compile  # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
```

Then in VS Code:
1. Press `F5` to start the debugger
2. A new VS Code window will open with the extension loaded
3. You should see "AWS Bedrock (Mantle)" in the chat provider dropdown

#### Step 2: Enable Debug Logging

Enable debug logging in VS Code settings:
```json
// .vscode/settings.json or VS Code settings
{
  "aws-bedrock.debugLogging": true
}
```

Then check the "AWS Bedrock" output channel (View → Output → AWS Bedrock) for detailed logs.

#### Step 3: Reproduce the Multi-turn Scenario

This is what demonstrates the fix working:

1. **Start a new chat** with an AWS Bedrock Converse API model (like Claude)
2. **Ask a question that triggers tool use:**
   ```
   "What's the current weather in New York? Please use the weather tool to find out."
   ```
   (This assumes the model/chat setup has tools available)

3. **Continue the conversation for many turns** (at least 10-15 more exchanges)
   - Ask follow-up questions
   - Make unrelated requests
   - Have regular text-only exchanges

4. **Make another request that doesn't need tools:**
   ```
   "Based on everything we've discussed, what would you recommend?"
   ```

#### Step 4: What to Look For

**Before the fix would cause:**
- Error around turn 10-43: "Expected toolResult blocks at messages.X.content for the following Ids: tooluse_..."
- Chat stops responding
- Error shown in GitHub Copilot Chat

**With the fix applied:**
- Conversation continues smoothly
- Tool blocks from earlier turns are preserved throughout
- No "Expected toolResult blocks" errors

**In the Debug Log:**
Look for entries like:
```
[timestamp] converseOnce: Using toolConfig (toolsInRequest=0, historyHasTools=true)
```

This indicates that even though the current request has 0 tools requested (`toolsInRequest=0`), 
the code detected that history has tool blocks (`historyHasTools=true`) and preserved them correctly.

### What the Fix Does

**Problem:**
- Tool result blocks were stripped from message history if the current request didn't include tool config
- This caused orphaned tool call blocks with missing results
- Bedrock API validation would fail

**Solution:**
The fix adds a check: `const hasTools = !!toolConfig || hasToolHistory(options.messages);`

This ensures:
1. If the current request includes tools → preserve all tool blocks ✓
2. If message history contains tool blocks → preserve them too ✓
3. Tool calls and results stay paired together ✓

### Manual Code Review

You can verify the changes by looking at:

#### `/src/bedrockNative.ts`
- **Line ~250**: `hasToolHistory()` function
- **Line ~420-425**: Tool preservation logic
- **Line ~435-440**: Debug logging

#### `/src/utils.ts`
- **Line ~133-175**: Enhanced `validateRequest()` function with improved tracking

### Running Both Test Files

```bash
# Simulate multi-turn conversation (tests the core logic)
node test-tool-preservation.js

# Verify implementation in actual source code and compiled output
node test-implementation.js
```

Both should show ✅ PASS.

### Testing with Real Bedrock API (Advanced)

To test against actual AWS Bedrock:

1. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure  # Or use AWS_PROFILE environment variable
   ```

2. In the debug extension:
   - Choose a **native Bedrock Converse model** (e.g., "Claude 3 Haiku (Native)")
   - Ensure you have a tool-compatible model
   - Run the multi-turn scenario above

3. The fix prevents the issue that occurred after ~43 messages with tool use

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "No AWS credentials found"**
- Solution: Run `aws configure` or set AWS_PROFILE environment variable

**Issue: "Model doesn't support tools"**
- Solution: Use a model known to support tool calling (Claude variants, etc.)

**Issue: Tool blocks still not preserved**
- Check that `aws-bedrock.debugLogging` is enabled
- Review the debug output for hasToolHistory detection
- Verify the fix was applied: check bedrockNative.ts line 420 should show `const hasTools = !!toolConfig || hasToolHistory...`

### Summary

The multi-turn conversation test (`test-tool-preservation.js`) demonstrates that with 40+ messages including tool use, the tool blocks are now correctly preserved. This prevents the "Expected toolResult blocks" validation error that was occurring in real usages around message turn 43.

The source code verification test (`test-implementation.js`) confirms that all implementation changes are in place in both the TypeScript source and compiled JavaScript output.
